## Me

I'm Glenn Rempe, and I live with my wife and daughter in San Francisco, CA where
I work in the technology industry. If you wanted to learn *just a little more* about
me this is the place to do it.

I enjoy travel (50+ countries, five continents, more to go!), SCUBA diving, photography,
and continuously improving my technology and management skills.

Here you'll find links to some of the key sites I frequent, learn how
to [contact me](/contact/) securely using [strong encryption](/keys/),
read a few [blog posts](/blog/), see some recent open source [projects](/projects/) I've
been working on, or view my [Résumé](/resume/).

## This Site

### Goals

It was long past time to retire my previous homepage at
[rempe.us](https://www.rempe.us/), and update it with something a bit
more functional. In researching what technology I wanted to use I had a
few guiding principles. In a word, ***simplicity***.

* Keep the UX simple and **clean**
* Present a 'mobile first' **responsive** UI
* Stay lightweight and **fast** (< 500ms load time) even under extreme load
* **Secure** HTTPS/TLS only
* Provide **machine readable** sitemap and Atom RSS feeds
* Be secure and **impenetrable** to hacking and resistant to DDoS
* **Easily deployable** to production
* Simple content creation
* All content and code **versionable** in Git, with **signed** commits
* Require minimal or **no operational overhead** (web & database servers)
* Highly **cacheable** and global CDN friendly
* Entail **minimal cost**, free preferred

Keeping all of this in mind, *I believe I have achieved all of these goals*. Read on
to learn more about the technology choices I made along the way.

### The Technology Platform

#### Development

I currently do all development locally on a quad-core 15" Macbook Pro with Retina
Display, using the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor. I use
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to manage almost all of the various other development
dependencies.

#### Jekyll

The entire site is static HTML, CSS, and images that are generated by the
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) framework. All content is written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the
[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) templating language. The pages
that are generated are all standards compliant [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
with a [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) mobile
first layout that allows the site to work equally well on your iPhone or your desktop.

All content and code is stored in a Git repository, hosted and publicly available
on Github @ [https://github.com/grempe/grempe.github.io](https://github.com/grempe/grempe.github.io)
and every commit is cryptographically [signed with my Blog Signing Key](/keys/).

#### Github Pages

All code and content changes are pushed to Github and the static site is generated
by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) automatically and hosted on my personal
Github page at [grempe.github.io](https://grempe.github.io/).

My DNS server is configured with the following records that point to Github servers:

{% highlight text %}
CNAME www.rempe.us -> grempe.github.io
A         rempe.us -> 192.30.252.153
A         rempe.us -> 192.30.252.154
{% endhighlight %}

With this DNS configuration, Github becomes the canonical host for [www.]rempe.us.
The rempe.us apex domain redirects to www.rempe.us

Github routes my content through the [Fastly.com](https://www.fastly.com/customers/github) CDN.

#### CloudFlare CDN

I use [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/overview/) to:

* Manage my DNS records
* Serve as my primary CDN
* Terminate both IPv4 and IPv6 connections
* Provide SSL/TLS certificate for [www.]rempe.us
* Provide DDoS Attack prevention
* Prevent malicious visitors from scraping
* Serve HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2 + SPDY client connections
* Serve all content with [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) (6 month expiry)
* Continue serving the site in case Github goes down

CloudFlare DNS is configured to route requests for [www.]rempe.us through
its own CDN first and caches all content automatically.

Using CloudFlare SSL/TLS certificates I am able to achieve an [**A+** SSL/TLS test
rating from Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=rempe.us&latest)
for both IPv4 and IPv6 connections to [www.]rempe.us.

#### Proof of Ownership

I [host a signed certificate on this site and domain](https://www.rempe.us/keybase.txt)
that allows you to cryptographically verify that I control all content here.
You can verify using [keybase.io/grempe](https://keybase.io/grempe).
