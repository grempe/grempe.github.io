I'm Glenn Rempe, and I live with my wife and daughter in San Francisco, CA where
I work in the technology industry. If you wanted to learn *just a little more* about
me this is the place to do it.

I enjoy travel (50+ countries, five continents, more to go!), SCUBA diving, photography,
and continuously improving my technology and management skills.

Here you'll find links to some of the key sites I frequent, learn how
to [contact me](/contact/) securely using [strong encryption](/keys/),
read a few [blog posts](/blog/), see some recent open source [projects](/projects/) I've
been working on, or view my [Résumé](/resume/).
