I'm Glenn Rempe, and I live with my wife and two daughters in San Francisco, CA. I'm the CEO of a new startup in the Blockchain and cryptography space.

Previously, I was the VP Engineering, and Director of Engineering at two Silicon Valley startups and I've lead software engineering and consulting teams at Fortune 500 technology companies worldwide.

I care deeply about security and privacy, continuous learning, software craftsmanship, open source, cloud computing, and making the world better with cryptography.

maintained over the years.
