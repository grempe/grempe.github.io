I verify that the following public Bitcoin addresses are mine and can be used to send funds to me.

These <span class="fa fa-btc"></span> Bitcoin addresses are implicitly signed by my [Blog Signing Key](/keys/) since
they are included in this signed Git repository. Additionally, each is accompanied by a
Bitcoin signature to verify I control the private key for that coin. You can use your
own Bitcoin client, or the online tool at [chainquery.com](https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/verifymessage){:target="_blank"}
to verify each signature.

Additionally, I have my [coinbase.com/grempe](https://www.coinbase.com/){:target="_blank"}
profile page which can be used to send funds to a dynamically generated Bitcoin address
that I control.
