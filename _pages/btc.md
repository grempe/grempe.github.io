I verify that the following are public Bitcoin addresses that I control and
which can be used to send funds to me.

These <span class="fa fa-btc"></span> Bitcoin addresses are implicitly signed
by my [Blog Signing Key](/keys/) since they are included in this signed Git
repository. Additionally, each is accompanied by a Bitcoin signature to verify
I control the private key for that coin. You can use your own Bitcoin client,
or the online tool at [chainquery.com](https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/verifymessage){:target="_blank"}
to verify each signature.

## Coinbase Addresses

Additionally, I have a [coinbase.com/grempe](https://www.coinbase.com/grempe){:target="_blank"}
profile page which can be used to send funds to a dynamically generated Bitcoin address
that I control. The proof that I control this account, which is cryptographically
verifiable, can be found in my [keybase.io/grempe](https://keybase.io/grempe){:target="_blank"}
profile.
