Something I am passionate about is the ability for each of us to communicate freely
while maintaining the confidentiality of our communications. The right to privacy
is a [fundamental human right](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/united-nations-encryption-and-online-anonymity-are-basic-human-rights){:target="\_blank"}.

Privacy and security are not at odds with each other, and are essential to the
freedoms and liberties we enjoy. Strong encryption, used liberally, gives us
many of the tools we need to ensure we maintain these freedoms.

I would encourage you to learn more, and to make use of the tools at hand to
communicate with me. The [EFF Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org){:target="\_blank"}
site is a great starting point.

Here are some good ways to contact me, with varying security properties.

## Email

ProTip : If you don't know how to use PGP, but still want to send an encrypted message, you can [encrypt a text message to me using Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/encrypt#grempe){:target="\_blank"} and simply copy + paste the encrypted message into an email.

### Standard Security

Unless you send encrypted email, the expectation of privacy is pretty low.

- [glenn@rempe.us](mailto:glenn@rempe.us)

Please feel free to encrypt sensitive messages to me using PGP with [my PGP public key with ID 0x7FFCB72A6522542E]({{ "/keys/" | relative_url }}).

_Supports : Plain Text / Encrypted Text / Attached Photos / Attached Documents_

### High Security

- [grempe@pm.me](mailto:grempe@pm.me)

Sensitive emails should be sent to my [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com){:target="\_blank"}
account. It is best if you also use your own ProtonMail account to send messages to me, as that
ensures the message will be encrypted end-to-end. Read more about [ProtonMail Security](https://protonmail.com/security-details){:target="\_blank"}.

If you don't have a ProtonMail account please feel free to encrypt sensitive messages
to me using PGP with [my PGP public key with ID 0x7FFCB72A6522542E]({{ "/keys/" | relative_url }})

_Supports : Plain Text / Encrypted Text / Attached Photos / Attached Documents_

## Messaging

### Keybase

[Keybase](https://keybase.io/grempe){:target="\_blank"} with username `grempe` is the best way to chat, send encrypted messages, or confirm my online identities.

### Signal

[Signal](https://signal.org){:target="\_blank"} is my preferred method of secure real-time chat. You'll need to already know my mobile number to reach me with Signal. If you don't know that number please reach out to me using Keybase.

[Signal](https://signal.org){:target="\_blank"} is the current "Gold Standard" by those that I respect in the security and cryptography field. Researchers have prepared [A Formal Security Analysis of the Signal Messaging Protocol (PDF)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf){:target="\_blank"} and found it to be without any major
flaws.

Signal [has also demonstrated extremely limited access to metadata](https://whispersystems.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/){:target="\_blank"} that
they can make available, even to governments with lawful orders.

I may ask you to [verify your safety numbers](https://whispersystems.org/blog/safety-number-updates/){:target="\_blank"}.
