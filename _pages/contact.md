Something I am passionate about is the ability for each of us to communicate freely
while maintaining a sense of privacy in our communications. The right to privacy
and security are not something given to us by governments, they are fundamental
human rights.

Privacy and security are not at odds with each other, and are essential to the
freedoms and liberties we enjoy. Strong encryption, used liberally, gives us
many of the tools we need to ensure we maintain these freedoms.

I would encourage you to learn more, and to make use of the tools at hand to
communicate with me. The [EFF Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org){:target="_blank"}
pages are a great starting point.

### Email (low security)

My primary email address is hosted by Google. Feel free to send me PGP encrypted
email using [my PGP public keys](/keys/). Expectations of privacy are low.

* [glenn@rempe.us](mailto:glenn@rempe.us)

*Supports : Plain Text / Encrypted Text / Attached Photos / Attached Documents*


### Email (higher security)

* [grempe@protonmail.com](mailto:grempe@protonmail.com)

Sensitive emails should be sent to my [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) account.
ProtonMail is a secure email service based in Switzerland and uses
[end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)
when possible.

If you also have an account with ProtonMail (which is free and anonymous),
and send email to me from that account, our emails will be end-to-end encrypted
(a good thing).

If you send from another email provider, our messages
may not be encrypted and may be stored on your mail server un-encrypted. In this
case please send me PGP encrypted email (in-line, not mime attached)
using [my PGP public email key](/keys/).

Get a free [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) account, its better for everyone.

### Signal

Open Whisper Systems [Signal](https://whispersystems.org) is currently thought
to be very secure by people that I respect in the security industry.  Signal
is my preferred method of secure contact and supports voice, group text, private
text, picture, and video messages. If you have my mobile number in your phone's contact list then
you can reach me with Signal. If you need my phone number to contact me
via Signal please request it via email.

My Fingerprint (mobile phone):

``` text
05 22 c2 83 26 44 ac 16 7d
ff 3f a8 42 95 21 74 01 85
a9 e4 f5 04 40 04 8a 9f 5a
94 65 c9 22 9f 76
```

[How do I verify your fingerprint?](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/wiki/FAQ){:target="_blank"}
Within a Signal conversation, do a long press on my name at the top of the window.
It will show both my fingerprint and yours.

### WhatsApp

WhatsApp, at least as of the
[rollout of end-to-end encryption on 4/5/2016](https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000618/end-to-end-encryption),
doesn't make it too easy to verify your fingerprint out-of-band.

If you're connected with me on WhatsApp, view the verification UI with the QR code
and the 60 digit long fingerprint. My portion of the fingerprint will be
either the first six, or the last six blocks (30 digits) of that verifier. Your
portion of the fingerprint is the other six blocks. One of:

``` text
56143 41025 77814 55362 45113 58854 + YOURS
YOURS + 56143 41025 77814 55362 45113 58854
```

### Apple FaceTime

I use [Apple FaceTime](https://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/) extensively. You can
contact me using FaceTime by adding my contact email address [glenn@rempe.us](mailto:glenn@rempe.us)
to your contacts on your Mac or iOS device.
