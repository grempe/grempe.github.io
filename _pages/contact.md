Something I am passionate about is the ability for each of us to communicate freely
while maintaining the confidentiality of our communications. The right to privacy
is a [fundamental human right](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/united-nations-encryption-and-online-anonymity-are-basic-human-rights){:target="_blank"}.

Privacy and security are not at odds with each other, and are essential to the
freedoms and liberties we enjoy. Strong encryption, used liberally, gives us
many of the tools we need to ensure we maintain these freedoms.

I would encourage you to learn more, and to make use of the tools at hand to
communicate with me. The [EFF Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org){:target="_blank"}
site is a great starting point.

Here are some good ways to contact me, with varying security properties.

## Email

### Standard Security

Unless you send encrypted email, the expectation of privacy is pretty low.

* [glenn@rempe.us](mailto:glenn@rempe.us)

Please feel free to encrypt sensitive messages to me using PGP with [my PGP public key with ID 0x7FFCB72A6522542E]({{ "/keys/" | relative_url }}).

*Supports : Plain Text / Encrypted Text / Attached Photos / Attached Documents*


### High Security

* [grempe@pm.me](mailto:grempe@pm.me)

Sensitive emails should be sent to my [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com){:target="_blank"}
account. It is best if you also use your own ProtonMail account to send messages to me, as that
ensures the message will be encrypted end-to-end. Read more about [ProtonMail Security](https://protonmail.com/security-details){:target="_blank"}.

If you don't have a ProtonMail account please feel free to encrypt sensitive messages
to me using PGP with [my PGP public key with ID 0x7FFCB72A6522542E]({{ "/keys/" | relative_url }})

*Supports : Plain Text / Encrypted Text / Attached Photos / Attached Documents*

## Messaging

### Signal

[Signal](https://signal.org) is my preferred method of secure real-time contact. If you know my mobile number
you can reach me with Signal.

[Signal](https://signal.org) is currently believed
to be highly secure by those that I respect in the security and cryptography field.
Researchers have prepared [A Formal Security Analysis of the Signal Messaging Protocol (PDF)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1013.pdf) and found it to be without any major
flaws.

Signal [has also demonstrated that they have extremely little metadata](https://whispersystems.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/){:target="_blank"} that
they can make available, even to governments even with lawful orders.

I may ask you to [verify your safety numbers](https://whispersystems.org/blog/safety-number-updates/){:target="_blank"}.
